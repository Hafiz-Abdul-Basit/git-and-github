Open source projects come with a lot of demands, so many skills and applications are required to accomplish the tasks. This characteristic accords you as a contributor the opportunity to practice and build on skills you already have, and to acquire new skills as well.

Contributing to open source will allow you to practice in many fields that include (but are not limited to) graphic design, coding, writing, user interface design, organizing, and many others.
